    "In order to facilitate SNA, we extracted additional information regarding scenes and dialogue order in scenes.   The data is organized and saved as follows:  \n",
    "\n",
    "*  Seinfield_Metadata.csv:   Episode metadata - KEY: Ep/SeasonNum, AirDate, EpTitle, Director\n",
    "*  Seinfield_Cast.csv:   Cast - KEY Ep/SeasonNum,  Actor Name, Character\n",
    "*  Seinfield_Writers.csv:   Writers - KEY Ep/SeasonNum,  Writer Name\n",
    "*  Seinfield_Dialogue.csv:   Dialogue - KEY Ep/SeasonNum,  Character,  Text, SceneNum, DialogueIndex \n",
    "\n",
    "Of particular interest here is the organization of the Script data.   The data is organized by scene so that SNA could potentially be performed showing when characters are interacting in a scene.   The Index helps show the order of the dialogue in the scene.  It resets for each scene.  \n",

    "### Episode Details\n",
    "\n",
    "We extracted all episodes except 100-101 and 177-178 which were clip shows.   They followed a different format and other than some short perfunctory introductions by main characters, their data is all contained in the original episodes."
